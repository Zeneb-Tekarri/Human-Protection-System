## Project Overview ##

The "Human Protection Against Gas and Flame" project is a comprehensive initiative aimed at enhancing human safety by designing an embedded system for the detection of hazardous gases and flames. This system is crucial due to the alarming rates of fatalities caused by gas asphyxiation and burns in Tunisia, especially during the winter season. The primary goal is to mitigate these risks by leveraging modern microelectronics and microcomputing technologies, particularly through the use of Arduino boards and various sensors.

## Objectives ##

1. Detection of Hazardous Gases:
   - Utilize MQ2 gas sensors to detect gases like carbon monoxide (CO), methane (CH4), propane, butane, and other harmful substances.
   - Implement sensitivity adjustments to ensure accurate and timely detection.

2. Flame Detection: 
   - Employ flame sensors that are sensitive to specific wavelengths and frequencies of light emitted by flames to accurately identify the presence of open fire.

3. Alert Mechanisms:
   - Integrate visual (LEDs) and auditory (buzzers) alert systems to notify users of detected hazards.
   - Use GSM modules for remote alerts via SMS or calls.

4. Preventive Measures: 
   - Install fans to reduce gas concentration in the event of a leak.
   - Use servomotors for mechanical actions such as shutting off gas supply.

## System Components ##

- Arduino Uno: The core microcontroller board used for processing inputs from sensors and controlling output devices.
  
- MQ2 Gas Sensors: Semi-conductor sensors that detect various gases and smoke, providing rapid measurements and adjustable sensitivity.

- Flame Sensors: Devices designed to detect light from flames, distinguishing it from other light sources by focusing on specific optical wavelengths.

- LED Indicators: Green, yellow, and red LEDs provide visual alerts based on the type and severity of the detected hazard.

- Buzzers: Emit sound alarms to alert users of danger.

- Fans and Servomotors: 
   Fans help ventilate areas to disperse harmful gases.
   Servomotors perform mechanical operations to prevent further hazards.

- GSM Module (SIM900): Allows the system to send notifications and alerts via SMS, enhancing remote monitoring capabilities.

## Software and Simulation ##

- Arduino Software (IDE): An open-source platform used for programming the Arduino board and managing its inputs and outputs.
  
- Proteus 8 Professional (ISIS): A software tool for simulating and testing the embedded systemâ€™s circuit designs.

- KiCad: Used for designing and visualizing the electronic circuits of the project.

## Conclusion ##

This project represents a vital step towards improving safety measures against gas leaks and fire hazards in domestic, industrial, and educational settings. By integrating modern technology with practical safety solutions, the project aims to provide a reliable system that can preemptively alert users, thus preventing potential accidents and saving lives.
